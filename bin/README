* Alignment is performed against cDNA, ncRNA and genome.
* Full alignment and annotation pipeline is in a single perl script (cdna_alignment).


The perl and python scripts in this folder can be used to perform the alignment of probe sequences
of Affymetrix microarrays to the genome and to generate custom CDF files from these alignments.

Folder bin/cfg contains config files with settings for HuExon, HuGene, MoExon and MoGene microarrays.

Script files for alignment are:
huexon_annotation.sh
hugene_annotation.sh
mogene_annotation.sh
moexon_annotation.sh
annotation_pipeline.py
align_exonerate.pl
parse_exonerate.pl
annotate_alignments.pl
processProbeMapping.pl
create_exon_transcript_table.pl
define_nonoverlapping_exon_regions.pl

The whole alignment and annotation pipeline is started by the shell scripts and the various
scripts are called sequentially as illustrated for the HuGene microarray:
hugene_annotation.sh
|-> annotation_pipeline.py
      |-> align_exonerate.pl
            |-> parse_exonerate.pl
            |-> annotate_alignments.pl
      |-> processProbeMapping.pl
      |-> create_exon_transcript_table.pl
      |-> define_nonoverlapping_exon_regions.pl

align_exonerate is thereby called iteratively for each chromosome.
align_exonerate.pl calls exonerate to align all probe sequences against the sequence of a chromosome.
parse_exonerate.pl reads the exonerate output file and stores alignments that pass a filter criteria to the
		      annotation database.
annotate_alignments.pl queries the Ensembl core database to determine whether probe alignments are
		       inside exon boundaries.
processProbeMapping.pl simply summarizes alignment information for each individual probe.
create_exon_transcript_table.pl queries the Ensembl core database and creates a database table
			containing all exons and transcripts.
define_nonoverlapping_exon_regions.pl creates a database table defining so called exon regions, which
		 	are non-overlapping parts of exons of the same gene. for a detailed description see
			Rainer et al. Molecular Endocrinology 2012.


Custom CDF files.
makeCdfFromDB.pl and makeGeneCdfFromDB.pl are perl scripts that create (text file) CDF files.

check_update_Ensembl.pl is a very useful script that compares locally downloaded versions of
 			Ensembl (API, fasta files etc) with the available online version and
			downloads eventual newer versions. Allows to download the perl API,
			genomic fasta files and the Ensembl core MySQL database.

getCVS.sh, installEnsemblDB.pl are simple scripts to fetch the Ensembl perl API or Ensembl databases.
